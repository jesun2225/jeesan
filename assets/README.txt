This folder is where you should put your real media files used by the bio page.

Expected filenames used by the page (replace these with your files):
- background.mp4  (video file)
- background-audio.mp3  (optional audio file)

Notes:
- Place optimized H.264 MP4 and/or WebM files for wide browser support.
- If you do not provide an audio file, the page will play the video's internal audio once unmuted.
- For testing, run a local server (see parent README.md).
